And is that fair?\\\\n\\\\nFor the US, which has to prove that Google somehow broke the law to achieve the status quo, this legal case could be an uphill battle. But for the rest of us, it offers a rare opportunity for some insight into what the tech giant does with its enormous market share. Is it still focused on being the best? Or, as has been alleged, does it use its ubiquity to squeeze us for money even at the expense of product quality? How ‘organic’ are Google’s results? This month, Wired posted an opinion article by lawyer and privacy advocate Megan Gray, which alleged that Google had accidentally revealed during the trial that it manipulates people’s search queries for maximum ad revenue. The example given was replacing a search for “children’s clothing” with “NIKOLAI-brand kidswear”. Loading Google rejected this in very strong terms, saying the piece was misleading and inaccurate while denying ever altering search terms. \\\",\\\"chunk_id\\\":\\\"401\\\",\\\"score\\\":0.01639344262295082},{\\\"chunk\\\":\\\"Flipboard becomes a federated app with support for ActivityPub\\\\n\\\\nFor Flipboard, after integrating its back end with the fediverse, the company may reconsider what its front end should look like, too, for this new age of social media.\\\\n\\\\n“The front end was built at a time pre-federation,” noted McCue. “What are the implications of federation in the front end?
