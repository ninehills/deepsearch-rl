persons attaining an M.A. were required to join the Church of England, King Charles intervened and said that Sheppard had a background in civil law (having studied at Gray's Inn) and was \"not prepared to take orders, he being a person of much ability\" (Ellis 255).","Instead, Sheppard became a courtier.","He was introduced to Nell Gwynn and became one of her favourite companions, along

H. Asquith succeeded to the premiership in 1908, Lloyd George replaced him as Chancellor of the Exchequer.","To fund extensive welfare reforms, he proposed taxes on land ownership and high incomes in the \"People's Budget\" (1909), which the Conservative-dominated House of Lords rejected.","The resulting constitutional crisis was only resolved after two elections in 1910 and the passage of the Parliament Act 1911.","His budget was then enacted alongside the National Insurance Act 1911 which helped to establish the modern welfare state.","In 1913, he was embroiled in the Marconi scandal but he remained in office and struggled to impose Irish Home Rule until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 suspended its implementation.","As wartime Chancellor, Lloyd George strengthened the country's finances and forged agreements with trade unions to maintain production.","In 1915, Asquith formed a Liberal-led wartime coalition with the Conservatives and Labour.","Lloyd George became Minister of Munitions and rapidly expanded production.","In 1916, he was appointed Secretary of State for War but was frustrated by his limited power and clashes with the military establishment over strategy.","Amid stalemate on the Western Front, confidence in Asquith's leadership waned.","He was forced to resign in December 1916;
